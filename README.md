# SAMPChatFilter

This ASI is a modification for [SA-MP](http://sa-mp.com/).
It hides chat lines containing specific words. This prevents spamming the chat.

Installation:
 - Install the ASI Loader
 - [Download SAMPChatFilter.asi](https://github.com/LuxXx/SAMPChatFilter/releases)
 - Copy ChatFilter.asi to your Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Installation
 - Create a file called "chatfilter.txt"
 - Write the stuff you want to supress into "chatfilter.txt"
 - When the game wants to print a line, the asi checks if a line of chatfilter.txt occures. If yes the line wont be printed
